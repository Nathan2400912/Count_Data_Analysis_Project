# RNA-seq Results Analyzer
This repository contains a project for the final assignment of the R Bioinformatics course (BF591) at Boston University. The goal of this project is to create an RShiny application for the manipulation and visualization of results from an RNA-seq experiment.

## Background
This app is made based on a study on Huntingtons Disease that contains RNA-seq results. The paper used is as follows: RNA Sequence Analysis of Human Huntington Disease Brain Reveals an Extensive Increase in Inflammatory and Developmental Gene Expression. Huntingtonâ€™s Disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. Transcriptional dysregulation in the human HD brain has been documented but is incompletely understood. Here we present a genome-wide analysis of mRNA expression in human prefrontal cortex from 20 HD and 49 neuropathologically normal controls using next generation high-throughput sequencing. 

## Data Preparation
This app contains four different tabs with different functions each requiring different csv files. To see how the data obtained and see how the different csv files are created, please refer to **file_preparation.Rmd**.
